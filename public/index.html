                        <p>
                            Most player systems like roll20 or the usual pen and paper method of playing D&D leave openings for players to
                            manipulate information between sessions. Keeping track of multiple groups and their respective sets of information
                            can be time consuming and often prone to errors if there's too much to handle. In most cases, as a campaign manager
                            your biggest issue lies in combing through player submissions to find their information which can extend the amount
                            of time spent in game looking information up rather than managing the actual session.

                        Minion Manager was developed to provide campaign managers a visual way to organize players into groups.
                        Each player block contains quick references to what matters most to managers.
                        Things like a player's name, email address, the number of sessions they've attended, the experience they were last awarded,
                        and their current loot are all available at a glance.
